        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Himalayan Hacks is on a mission to empower underprivileged children in Nepal. Our focus is on introducing these young minds to the fascinating realms of Computer Science and Engineering. Nepal, a nation of immense natural beauty, also grapples with educational disparities. We strive to bridge this gap by offering short educational programs, workshops, and mentorship to inspire these children towards valuable skills that can shape their futures.
          Through hands-on learning experiences, we aim to spark their curiosity and creativity while fostering a sense of confidence and self-belief. Our team is committed to creating an inclusive and supportive environment where every child feels valued. Join us in our endeavor to make a positive impact on the lives of Nepal's youth. Together, we can provide them with the tools, knowledge, and inspiration needed to build a brighter future through education and technology.

      </div>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Create the device</h1>
         <h3>We will be creating device with Raspberry Pi's that can run games and play games easily. These consoles will look almost like a hold hand-held gaming device and will have 3D printed casing, a LCD, a D-pad plus two buttons.</h3> </div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1> Add the software</h1>
        <h3> We are using the LÃ–VE software on the Raspberry Pi's to teach programming, since the frame work is built on lua and because its 2D game style will compliment our raspberry pi consoles.</h3>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Travel to Nepal plus set up</h1> <h3> This ones a tad bit obvious, we have to go to Nepal and set up the event in Makari Ucha Madhyamik Bidhyala School.</h3></div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Teach and hold a small "Hackathon"</h1>  <h3>For the first day we will teach the kids lua, this is a pretty easy programing language thats usally used for game development. On the next day we will have a eight hour competion where the kids will go head to head for some cool prizes.  </h3> </div>
