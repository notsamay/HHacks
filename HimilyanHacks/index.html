        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Himalayan Hacks is on a mission to empower underprivileged children in Nepal. Our focus is on introducing these young minds to the fascinating realms of Computer Science and Engineering. Nepal, a nation of immense natural beauty, also grapples with educational disparities. We strive to bridge this gap by offering short educational programs, workshops, and mentorship to inspire these children towards valuable skills that can shape their futures.
          Through hands-on learning experiences, we aim to spark their curiosity and creativity while fostering a sense of confidence and self-belief. Our team is committed to creating an inclusive and supportive environment where every child feels valued. Join us in our endeavor to make a positive impact on the lives of Nepal's youth. Together, we can provide them with the tools, knowledge, and inspiration needed to build a brighter future through education and technology.

      </div>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>3D print case</h1>
         <h3>We are going for a old school hand held design to make programming and playing easy.</h3> </div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Add a Raspbery Pi and other needed parts</h1>
        <h3> To the Game Boy case we are adding a Raspberry Pi, Buttons, D-Pads and a LCD to make our kits.</h3>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Make corresponding software</h1> <h3> With this kit that we are making, we are going to make a very simple programming interface for the kids to be able to easily make use of our hardwear.</h3></div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Travel to Nepal plus set up</h1> <h3> This ones a tad bit obvious, we have to go to Nepal and set up the event in a remote village's school.</h3></div>
      <br>
      <div class="goals hidden"><h1>Teach and hold a small "Hackathon"</h1>  <h3>We will give a basic run down on how to use the softwear and be availble for help but we will let the kids go head to head for some prizes because I believe that at its core engineering is a art, and you cant teach a art with too many rules.</h3> </div>
